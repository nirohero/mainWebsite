          <h2>📜 About me</h2>
          <p>
           I'm  a very kind and energetic person, I have a strong passion for technology and love to work on projects and make new websites. I mostly know front-end technologies at the moment, but I'm looking to expand into back-end one day.
          </p>
  
          <p>
           My daily routine would involve waking very early, anywhere from 4-6 am and then going to the gym to get a great workout in, workouts are what I am most passionate about in life and what helps me get through the day with a positive and ambitious outlook.
          </p>
  
          <p>
           After I come home, I drink my protein shake and then prepare to study for several hours, as long as I learn something new or do some practical coding daily I'm content.

          <h2> Work History</h2>
  
          <h3>Tata Consulting Services</h3>
          <p>
            I worked at this company for 2 years, and have been on  2 projects. The first project was with CIBC as a QA analyst , and the second one was at Sun Life Financial as a UI developer mostly using front-end skills.
          </p>
          <h3>Bulk Barn</h3>
          <p>
            At Bulk Barn I've earned most of my customer service skills through interactions and transactions, it was mostly a retail job but I don't think it should be overlooked due to the communicaiton and on-going tasks that I partook in daily.
